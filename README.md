# A Data Collection System Using Cloud Firestore with a Data Compression Method for Smart Home IoT Dashboard

The ever-growing volume of data generated by Internet of Things (IoT) devices necessitates efficient storage and retrieval mechanisms. This paper proposes a data collection system aimed at optimizing the storage space within the Firestore, a NoSQL schemeless cloud-based database, by implementing the GZIP lossless data compression technique, and aims to enhance data retrieval performance to dynamic web pages. The proposed database comprises two collections: the Temporary Collection, where raw data from IoT devices is temporarily stored every one-second interval, and the Archived Collection, where data older than one hour is compressed and archived. The web-based dashboard complements this architecture, offering a data visualization of the past hour by extracting a dataset from the Temporary Collection, while historical data is retrieved by decompressing data from the Archived Collection only when the user requests. Experimental results reveal a compression ratio of 4.803:1 and a space-saving ratio of 0.786, promising substantial cost savings on cloud-based platforms by reducing data size for storage and transmission. With a reasonable decompression time of 12.06 milliseconds and a significantly lower response time of 148.14 milliseconds compared to 1916.36 milliseconds of test cases, the proposed system remarkably improves real-time data processing, contributing to enriched user experiences and informed decision-making within the IoT web-based dashboard.
